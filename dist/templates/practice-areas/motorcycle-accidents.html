        <h3 class="section-header">Filing AZ Motorcycle Accident Lawsuits</h3>
        <p>If you or someone you love has been injured or killed in a motorcycle accident, there are issues that need to be clarified before you can make a sound decision regarding the filing of a claim for damages. Below are just a few examples of what needs to be done.</p><br>

        <h4 class="text-primary">Cause:</h4><p>The first issue to clarify is how the accident occurred. If it was a one-vehicle accident where the driver simply lost control of the motorcycle due to their own fault, it is likely that there would be no viable legal action in that regard. There is an exception, however, and that would be if this motorcycle accident occurred because of a defect in the bike that could not have been discovered by the driver before the crash. If the crash was caused by the driver of another vehicle and included problematic conduct such as speeding, the presence of alcohol or a failure to yield the right-of-way, there may very well be a viable action.</p><br>

        <h4 class="text-primary">Damages:</h4><p>Every legal action needs some form of damages in order to be considered valid. For instance, if a crash occurred and the damages included:</p>

        <ul class="fa-ul practicePageList">
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Motorcycle repairs and/or replacement</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Medical bills</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Physical rehabilitation costs</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Lost income</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Pain and suffering, both physical and emotional</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>These would all be considered valid damages that could rightfully be pursued and recovered in a civil law setting.</p>

        <p>Even if you have suffered injuries as a result of a motorcycle accident that was not your fault, an Arizona auto accident attorney would still need to help you decide if pursuing that particular defendant would be worth the trouble and potential expense. For instance, if the driver at fault has no income and no insurance, then your attorney would likely help you work towards a different strategy of recovery.  This analysis must include a close look at all of the evidence that could be brought to court, including that which will work against you.</p><br>
