        <p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can happen at any time and to anyone. The problem with these types of injuries is that the severity of the injury may not be noticed until it is too late to prevent serious damage. TBIs can range in severity from a mild concussion or other minor head injuries to more serious intracranial injuries that cause pressure buildup, bleeding in the brain, skull fractures, tears in the brain caused by lodged objects and projectiles, coma, and death.</p><br>
