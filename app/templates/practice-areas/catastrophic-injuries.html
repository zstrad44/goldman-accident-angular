        <p>It’s a simple truth that death is a natural part of life. However, death becomes an unnatural criminal act when a person’s life is cut short due to the negligent act or decision of another. Murder, homicide, gross negligence and unforeseen accidents are all causes of wrongful deaths.</p><br>

        <h3 class="section-header">What Damages Can be Recovered?</h3>
        <p>Through legal action, it is possible for families to not only gain closure and a sense of justice, but also financial compensation for past, current, and future expenses. Common types of economic and non-economic damages that may be awarded in an Arizona wrongful death case include:</p><br>
        <ul class="fa-ul practicePageList">
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Medical expenses for past treatment</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Loss of income and services if the victim had lived</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Funeral/burial expenses</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Loss of consortium, including companionship, love, and care</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Pain and suffering, such as the emotional and mental anguish associated with grief</li>
            <li> <i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Punitive damages that are intended to punish the at-fault party</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Every case is unique and a jury will determine the amount of damages that may be awarded based on the circumstances of the victim's death, the victim's income and expected future earnings, and the non-economic losses suffered by each eligible survivor.</p><br>

        <h3 class="section-header">Who May Sue for Wrongful Death?</h3>
        <p>When a person passes away, it is likely that many lives will be affected by the loss and in some cases, experience economic consequences. However, not everyone is entitled to sue the at-fault party for damages. In Arizona, the surviving spouse, children, parents, or guardian of a deceased person may lawfully pursue a wrongful death claim. A lawyer will act on behalf of the survivors, also known as beneficiaries, to ensure that the case is both uncomplicated and efficient, especially if there are several family members involved.</p><br>

        <h3 class="section-header">How Long Do I Have to File a Claim in Scottsdale?</h3>
        <p>In Arizona, survivors must file a wrongful death claim within two years of the death in order to be eligible for compensation. Failure to take legal action within the statute of limitations can result in the loss of right to assert a wrongful death claim. While a statute of limitations is generally strict, there are unique circumstances in which an individual may be able to file a claim after the specific time period has expired. An experienced and knowledgeable lawyer will be able to evaluate your case and determine whether you still have a potential claim.</p><br>
